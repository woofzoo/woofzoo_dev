# Phase 1: User Authentication & Registration - Acceptance Tests

## Overview
This document outlines acceptance tests for the user authentication and registration functionality of the WoofZoo Pet Management System.

---

## Test Case 1.1: Successful User Registration
**Given** a new user wants to create an account  
**When** they provide valid registration information including email, password, name, and phone number  
**Then** their account should be created successfully  
**And** they should receive a confirmation message  
**And** their email should be marked as unverified  
**And** a verification email should be sent to their email address  

## Test Case 1.2: Duplicate Email Registration
**Given** a user account already exists with a specific email address  
**When** another user tries to register with the same email address  
**Then** the registration should fail  
**And** an appropriate error message should be returned  
**And** no new account should be created  

## Test Case 1.3: Invalid Registration Data
**Given** a user attempts to register  
**When** they provide invalid data (invalid email format, weak password, missing required fields)  
**Then** the registration should fail  
**And** specific validation error messages should be returned  
**And** no account should be created  

## Test Case 1.4: Email Verification Process
**Given** a user has registered but not verified their email  
**When** they click the verification link in their email  
**Then** their email should be marked as verified  
**And** they should be redirected to a success page  
**And** they should be able to log in to the system  

## Test Case 1.5: Successful User Login
**Given** a verified user has an account  
**When** they provide correct email and password credentials  
**Then** they should be successfully logged in  
**And** they should receive access and refresh tokens  
**And** their user information should be returned  

## Test Case 1.6: Failed Login Attempts
**Given** a user attempts to log in  
**When** they provide incorrect email or password  
**Then** the login should fail  
**And** an appropriate error message should be returned  
**And** no tokens should be issued  

## Test Case 1.7: Token Refresh
**Given** a user has a valid refresh token  
**When** they request a new access token using their refresh token  
**Then** a new access token should be issued  
**And** the token should be valid for the configured duration  

## Test Case 1.8: Password Reset Flow
**Given** a user has forgotten their password  
**When** they request a password reset with their email address  
**Then** a password reset email should be sent  
**And** they should receive a reset token  
**When** they use the reset token to set a new password  
**Then** their password should be updated successfully  
**And** they should be able to log in with the new password  

## Test Case 1.9: Change Password
**Given** an authenticated user wants to change their password  
**When** they provide their current password and a new password  
**Then** their password should be updated successfully  
**And** they should be able to log in with the new password  
**And** their old password should no longer work  

## Test Case 1.10: Logout Functionality
**Given** an authenticated user is logged in  
**When** they log out of the system  
**Then** their session should be terminated  
**And** their access token should be invalidated  
**And** they should be required to log in again for protected resources

## Test Execution Notes
- All authentication tests should use unique email addresses
- Token expiration should be tested with realistic timeouts
- Email verification should be tested with both valid and invalid tokens
- Password strength requirements should be validated
- Rate limiting should be considered for login attempts
