# Phase 8: Performance & Security - Acceptance Tests

## Overview
This document outlines acceptance tests for performance and security aspects of the WoofZoo Pet Management System.

---

## Test Case 8.1: Large Dataset Handling
**Given** the system contains a large number of pets, owners, and families  
**When** users perform queries and operations  
**Then** responses should be returned within acceptable time limits  
**And** pagination should work correctly  
**And** system performance should remain stable  

## Test Case 8.2: Concurrent User Access
**Given** multiple users are accessing the system simultaneously  
**When** they perform various operations  
**Then** all operations should complete successfully  
**And** data consistency should be maintained  
**And** no race conditions should occur  

## Test Case 8.3: Data Isolation
**Given** multiple users have their own pets and families  
**When** they access the system  
**Then** each user should only see their own data  
**And** family members should only see shared family data  
**And** data isolation should be properly enforced  

## Test Case 8.4: API Rate Limiting
**Given** a user makes many requests in a short time period  
**When** they exceed rate limits  
**Then** appropriate rate limiting responses should be returned  
**And** legitimate users should not be affected  
**And** system resources should be protected  

## Test Case 8.5: Security Validation
**Given** various security scenarios (SQL injection attempts, XSS attempts, etc.)  
**When** malicious requests are made  
**Then** the system should reject these requests  
**And** security measures should prevent exploitation  
**And** system integrity should be maintained  

## Test Case 8.6: Authentication Security
**Given** various authentication attack scenarios  
**When** attackers attempt to compromise authentication  
**Then** the system should prevent unauthorized access  
**And** security measures should detect and block attacks  
**And** legitimate users should not be affected  

## Test Case 8.7: Data Encryption
**Given** sensitive data is stored in the system  
**When** data is transmitted and stored  
**Then** data should be properly encrypted  
**And** encryption should meet security standards  
**And** data should be protected at rest and in transit  

## Test Case 8.8: Session Management
**Given** users have active sessions  
**When** sessions are managed by the system  
**Then** sessions should be properly secured  
**And** session timeouts should work correctly  
**And** session hijacking should be prevented  

## Test Case 8.9: Input Validation and Sanitization
**Given** various types of user input are provided  
**When** the system processes the input  
**Then** input should be properly validated and sanitized  
**And** malicious input should be rejected  
**And** system security should be maintained  

## Test Case 8.10: File Upload Security
**Given** users upload various types of files  
**When** files are processed by the system  
**Then** files should be properly validated  
**And** malicious files should be rejected  
**And** file storage should be secure  

## Test Case 8.11: Database Security
**Given** database operations are performed  
**When** data is accessed and modified  
**Then** database security should be maintained  
**And** SQL injection should be prevented  
**And** data integrity should be preserved  

## Test Case 8.12: API Security
**Given** API endpoints are accessed  
**When** requests are made to the API  
**Then** API security should be enforced  
**And** unauthorized access should be prevented  
**And** API abuse should be detected and blocked  

## Test Case 8.13: Logging and Monitoring
**Given** system activities occur  
**When** activities are logged and monitored  
**Then** security events should be properly logged  
**And** suspicious activities should be detected  
**And** audit trails should be maintained  

## Test Case 8.14: Backup Security
**Given** system backups are created  
**When** backups are stored and accessed  
**Then** backups should be properly secured  
**And** backup integrity should be maintained  
**And** backup access should be controlled  

## Test Case 8.15: Compliance and Privacy
**Given** user data is processed  
**When** data privacy requirements are considered  
**Then** privacy regulations should be complied with  
**And** user consent should be properly managed  
**And** data retention policies should be enforced

## Test Execution Notes
- Performance tests should use realistic load patterns
- Security tests should follow industry best practices
- Compliance tests should verify regulatory requirements
- Monitoring and alerting should be tested for effectiveness
- Disaster recovery procedures should be validated
