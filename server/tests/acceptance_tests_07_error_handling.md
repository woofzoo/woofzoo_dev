# Phase 7: Error Handling & Edge Cases - Acceptance Tests

## Overview
This document outlines acceptance tests for error handling and edge cases in the WoofZoo Pet Management System.

---

## Test Case 7.1: Authentication Token Expiration
**Given** a user has an expired access token  
**When** they try to access protected resources  
**Then** they should receive an authentication error  
**And** they should be prompted to refresh their token or re-authenticate  

## Test Case 7.2: Invalid Token Handling
**Given** a user provides an invalid or malformed token  
**When** they try to access protected resources  
**Then** they should receive an authentication error  
**And** they should be prompted to log in again  

## Test Case 7.3: Unauthorized Access Attempts
**Given** a user tries to access resources they don't have permission for  
**When** they make requests to protected endpoints  
**Then** they should receive an authorization error  
**And** access should be denied  

## Test Case 7.4: Data Validation Errors
**Given** a user submits invalid data  
**When** the system processes the request  
**Then** appropriate validation errors should be returned  
**And** the invalid data should not be stored  
**And** helpful error messages should guide the user  

## Test Case 7.5: Business Rule Violations
**Given** a user attempts an action that violates business rules  
**When** the system processes the request  
**Then** appropriate business rule errors should be returned  
**And** the action should not be completed  
**And** the system state should remain consistent  

## Test Case 7.6: System Error Handling
**Given** a system error occurs (database failure, storage failure, etc.)  
**When** users make requests  
**Then** appropriate error responses should be returned  
**And** system stability should be maintained  
**And** error logging should occur for debugging  

## Test Case 7.7: Network Connectivity Issues
**Given** network connectivity is intermittent  
**When** users make requests to the system  
**Then** appropriate error handling should occur  
**And** users should be informed of connectivity issues  
**And** retry mechanisms should be available  

## Test Case 7.8: Database Connection Failures
**Given** the database connection fails  
**When** users make requests that require database access  
**Then** appropriate error responses should be returned  
**And** the system should attempt to reconnect  
**And** users should be informed of the issue  

## Test Case 7.9: File Storage Failures
**Given** the file storage system fails  
**When** users attempt to upload or download files  
**Then** appropriate error responses should be returned  
**And** the system should handle the failure gracefully  
**And** users should be informed of the issue  

## Test Case 7.10: Email Service Failures
**Given** the email service fails  
**When** users trigger email-dependent actions (registration, password reset, etc.)  
**Then** appropriate error responses should be returned  
**And** the system should handle the failure gracefully  
**And** users should be informed of the issue  

## Test Case 7.11: Concurrent Modification Conflicts
**Given** multiple users modify the same resource simultaneously  
**When** conflicts occur  
**Then** appropriate conflict resolution should occur  
**And** data integrity should be maintained  
**And** users should be informed of the conflict  

## Test Case 7.12: Resource Not Found Errors
**Given** a user requests a resource that doesn't exist  
**When** the system processes the request  
**Then** a "not found" error should be returned  
**And** the error message should be helpful  
**And** the user should be guided to valid resources  

## Test Case 7.13: Rate Limiting
**Given** a user makes many requests in a short time period  
**When** they exceed rate limits  
**Then** appropriate rate limiting responses should be returned  
**And** legitimate users should not be affected  
**And** system resources should be protected  

## Test Case 7.14: Malicious Input Handling
**Given** malicious input is provided to the system  
**When** the system processes the input  
**Then** the input should be properly sanitized  
**And** security measures should prevent exploitation  
**And** system integrity should be maintained  

## Test Case 7.15: Graceful Degradation
**Given** a system component fails  
**When** users continue to use the system  
**Then** the system should continue to function with reduced capabilities  
**And** users should be informed of the limitations  
**And** core functionality should remain available

## Test Execution Notes
- Error scenarios should be tested with realistic failure conditions
- Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable
- System recovery should be tested after various failure scenarios
- Security vulnerabilities should be tested and prevented
- Performance should be monitored during error conditions
