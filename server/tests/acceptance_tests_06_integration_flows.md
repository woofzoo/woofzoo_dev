## Test Case 6.1: Complete Pet Registration Flow
**Given** a new user wants to register their pet  
**When** they complete the full registration process:
1. Register user account
2. Verify email
3. Create owner profile
4. Create pet profile
5. Upload pet photos
**Then** all steps should complete successfully  
**And** the pet should be fully registered in the system  
**And** all associated data should be properly linked  

## Test Case 6.2: Family Sharing Flow
**Given** a pet owner wants to share their pet with family members  
**When** they complete the family sharing process:
1. Create a family
2. Invite family members
3. Members accept invitations
4. Members access shared pets
**Then** all steps should complete successfully  
**And** family members should have appropriate access to pets  
**And** permissions should be enforced correctly  

## Test Case 6.3: Multi-Pet Owner Scenario
**Given** an owner has multiple pets  
**When** they manage all their pets through the system  
**Then** each pet should be properly organized  
**And** the owner should be able to switch between pets easily  
**And** all pet information should be accessible  

## Test Case 6.4: Cross-System Search
**Given** multiple pets, owners, and families exist in the system  
**When** users perform searches across different entities  
**Then** relevant results should be returned  
**And** search should work across related data  
**And** results should be properly ranked and filtered  

## Test Case 6.5: User Onboarding Flow

**When** they complete the onboarding process:
1. Register account
2. Verify email
3. Complete profile setup
4. Add first pet
5. Explore features
**Then** all steps should be intuitive and complete successfully

**And** they should be engaged to continue using the platform  

## Test Case 6.6: Pet Health Record Integration
**Given** a pet has health records and medical information  
**When** the pet profile is accessed  
**Then** health information should be properly integrated  
**And** medical history should be accessible to authorized users  
**And** data should be properly organized and searchable

## Test Execution Notes
- Integration tests should use realistic data volumes
- End-to-end flows should test complete user journeys
- Performance tests should simulate real-world usage patterns
- Data consistency should be verified across all operations
- Error recovery should be tested for all integration points
