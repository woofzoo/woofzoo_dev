## Test Execution Strategy

### Prerequisites
- Clean test database before each test phase
- Mock external services (email, storage) for isolated testing
- Set up test data and fixtures for each phase
- Configure test environment with appropriate settings

### Test Organization
- Each phase can be tested independently
- Tests within each phase should be executed in logical order
- Integration tests should be run after individual component tests
- Performance and security tests should be run in dedicated environments

### Test Data Management
- Use unique test data for each test to avoid conflicts
- Clean up test data after each test phase
- Maintain test data consistency across related tests
- Use realistic but manageable data volumes

### Reporting and Documentation
- Document test results for each phase
- Track test coverage and identify gaps
- Maintain test execution logs for debugging
- Update test specifications based on implementation changes

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Automation
- Convert acceptance tests to automated test scripts
- Use appropriate testing frameworks (pytest, etc.)
- Implement test fixtures and utilities
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing

### Test Environment
- Maintain separate test environments for different phases
- Use isolated databases for each test run
- Configure external service mocks appropriately
- Set up monitoring and logging for test execution

### Quality Assurance
- Review test specifications for completeness and accuracy
- Validate test cases against business requirements
- Ensure test coverage across all system components
- Maintain test documentation and keep it updated

---

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Reviews
- Review test specifications quarterly
- Update tests based on new features and requirements
- Remove obsolete test cases
- Add new test cases for discovered edge cases

### Version Control
- Track changes to test specifications
- Maintain test version compatibility with system versions
- Document breaking changes in test specifications
- Coordinate test updates with system releases

This index provides a comprehensive overview of the acceptance test strategy for the WoofZoo Pet Management System, ensuring thorough coverage of all system functionality.
