# Medical Records System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive pet medical records management system has been implemented with role-based access control, supporting doctors, clinics, pet owners, and family members.

## Completed Components

### 1. Database Models ✅
Created 10 new SQLAlchemy models representing the medical records system:

#### Infrastructure Models
- **ClinicProfile** (`clinic_profiles`) - Stores clinic business information
  - Fields: clinic_name, license_number, address, phone, email, operating_hours, services_offered
  - Links to users table via user_id (clinic owner)

- **DoctorProfile** (`doctor_profiles`) - Stores veterinarian credentials
  - Fields: license_number, specialization, years_of_experience, qualifications, bio
  - Links to users table via user_id (doctor account)

- **DoctorClinicAssociation** (`doctor_clinic_associations`) - Many-to-many doctor-clinic relationship
  - Fields: doctor_id, clinic_id, employment_type, is_active, joined_at
  - Supports: full_time, part_time, visiting, contractor

- **PetClinicAccess** (`pet_clinic_access`) - OTP-based access control
  - Fields: pet_id, clinic_id, doctor_id, owner_id, access_granted_at, access_expires_at, status, otp_id, purpose
  - Statuses: active, expired, revoked

#### Medical Records Models

  - Visit types: routine_checkup, emergency, surgery, vaccination, follow_up, other
  - Tracks created_by_user_id and created_by_role for audit trail

- **Prescription** (`prescriptions`) - Medication records
  - Fields: medical_record_id, pet_id, medication_name, dosage, frequency, route, duration, instructions, prescribed_by_doctor_id, dates, quantity, refills_allowed
  - Denormalized pet_id for fast queries

- **LabTest** (`lab_tests`) - Laboratory tests and results

  - Fields: pet_id, allergen, allergy_type, severity, symptoms, reaction_description, diagnosed_by_doctor_id
  - Types: food, medication, environmental, flea, other
  - Severities: mild, moderate, severe, life_threatening

- **Vaccination** (`vaccinations`) - Vaccination history
  - Fields: pet_id, vaccine_name, vaccine_type, administered_by_doctor_id, administered_at, clinic_id, next_due_date, batch_number, certificate_url, is_required_by_law
  - Tracks next due dates for reminders

### 2. Database Migration ✅
- **Migration File**: `11a7277f2a1a_add_medical_records_system_tables.py`
- Creates all 10 tables with proper foreign keys, indexes, and constraints
- Includes optimized indexes for common query patterns
- Ready to apply with: `alembic upgrade head`

### 3. Repositories ✅
Created 10 repository classes for data access layer:

#### Infrastructure Repositories
- **ClinicProfileRepository** - Clinic CRUD operations
  - Methods: get_by_user_id, get_by_license_number, get_active_clinics, get_verified_clinics, search_by_name

- **DoctorProfileRepository** - Doctor CRUD operations
  - Methods: get_by_user_id, get_by_license_number, get_active_doctors, get_verified_doctors, get_by_specialization

- **DoctorClinicAssociationRepository** - Association management
  - Methods: get_by_doctor_id, get_active_by_doctor_id, get_by_clinic_id, get_active_by_clinic_id, get_association, get_by_employment_type

  - Methods: get_by_pet_id, get_active_access, get_by_clinic_id, get_active_by_clinic, get_by_doctor_id, get_expired_access, revoke_access

#### Medical Records Repositories

## Access Control Matrix

| Role | Medical Records | Prescriptions | Lab Tests | Allergies | Vaccinations | Notes |
|------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Pet Owner** | Full (Create/Read/Update*) | Full | Full | Full | Full | Can add home medication records |
| **Family Member (Full)** | Create/Read (home meds only) | Read | Read | Read | Read | Can add home medication, marked as such |
| **Family Member (Read-Only)** | Read | Read | Read | Read | Read | View only |
| **Doctor** | Full (at assigned clinic) | Full | Full | Full | Full | Only for pets with active clinic access |
| **Clinic Owner** | Read (clinic's records only) | Read | Read | Read | Read | Can view records created at their clinic |

*Update is limited to administrative corrections, not clinical content. All changes are logged via created_by_user_id and created_by_role fields.

## Key Design Features

### 1. Hybrid Medical Records Structure
- Main `medical_records` table for visits/consultations
- Specialized tables (prescriptions, lab_tests, allergies, vaccinations) for detailed data
- Better performance than pure JSONB approach
- Easier to enforce constraints and relationships

### 2. Denormalization for Performance
- `pet_id` denormalized in child tables (prescriptions, lab_tests, etc.)
- Enables direct queries without joining through medical_records
- Significant performance gain for common queries like "all prescriptions for pet X"

### 3. OTP-Based Clinic Access
- Pet owners grant temporary access to clinics via OTP
- Access automatically expires after configurable period (default 24 hours)
- Can be revoked at any time by owner
- Tracks which doctor is assigned to each visit

### 4. Audit Trail
- All records track `created_by_user_id` and `created_by_role`
- Distinguishes doctor-added vs owner-added records
- Critical for trust, liability, and filtering
- Enables queries like "show only professional medical records"

### 5. Comprehensive Indexing
- All foreign keys indexed
- Temporal queries optimized (visit_date DESC, ordered_at DESC)
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Status/boolean fields indexed for filtering

## Next Steps (Pending Implementation)

### 1. Service Layer
Services to implement:
- **ClinicAccessService** - OTP validation, access grant/revoke logic
- **MedicalRecordService** - CRUD with role-based access control
- **PrescriptionService** - Prescription management with validation
- **LabTestService** - Lab test ordering and result tracking
- **AllergyService** - Allergy management with safety checks
- **VaccinationService** - Vaccination scheduling and reminders

- Doctor profile creation/update
- Medical record creation (with different schemas for doctor vs owner)
- Prescription creation with dosage validation
- Lab test creation and result entry
- Allergy creation with severity validation
- Vaccination scheduling
- File attachment upload

### 3. Controllers

- **Medical Record Access Log table removed** - As requested, audit logging table was skipped for current scope
- **OTP table name** - Fixed foreign key reference from `otp` to `otps` to match existing table

### Key Achievements
- All 10 models created with proper relationships and constraints
- All 10 repositories created with comprehensive query methods
- Database migration successfully generated
- Complete audit trail support via created_by fields
- Optimized indexes for performance
- Role-based access control foundation in place

### Testing Recommendations
Once service layer is complete:
1. Test OTP workflow for clinic access
2. Test role-based permission checks
3. Test medical record creation from different user types
4. Test querying medical history with date ranges
5. Test prescription expiry notifications
6. Test vaccination due date reminders
7. Test file attachment upload/download
8. Test clinic access revocation

## Summary

**What's Been Built:**
- Complete database schema for medical records management
- 10 SQLAlchemy models with proper relationships
- 10 repository classes for data access
- Database migration ready to apply
- Foundation for role-based access control

**Ready for Next Steps:**
- Service layer implementation with business logic
- Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- Controllers for HTTP request handling
- RESTful API routes
- Integration with existing authentication system
- Unit and integration tests
